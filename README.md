# Overview

In the tutorial, we build a CRUD REST API from scratch using .NET 6.
As you would expect, the backend system supports Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting breakfasts.


```js
POST /breakfasts
```

```json
{
    "name": "Vegan Sunshine",
    "description": "Vegan everything! Join us for a healthy breakfast..",
    "startDateTime": "2022-04-08T08:00:00",
    "endDateTime": "2022-04-08T11:00:00",
    "savory": [
        "Oatmeal",
        "Avocado Toast",
        "Omelette",
        "Salad"
    ],
    "Sweet": [
        "Cookie"
    ]
}
```
